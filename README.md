# FreeScaler 2
Upscaler app for macOS based on CoreML AI models<br><br>

FreeScaler is a free and open source tool used to upscale low resolution images using advanced AI models. 

NOW BASED ON COREML<br>
We have rewritten FreeScaler from scratch and now it is based on CoreML, it makes use of CoreML models in order to upscale images. On Apple Silicon Macs built-in models use the Neural Engine by default instead of GPU, resulting in a 10x speed increase compared to FreeScaler 1. Additionally, power consumption is reduced by 75%.

EASY<br>
It's a very simple tool, you just need to import an image, choose your favorite model, and you're done. 
An intuitive interface allows you to efficiently compare the original and the upscaled image.

CUSTOM MODELS<br>
FreeScaler allows you to import custom CoreML models. Please note that you must use only models with image as input and output.<br>
You can find a list of free CoreML models here: https://github.com/john-rocky/CoreML-Models
